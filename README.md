## Action
An action is a call for concrete work from supporters. It can stand on its own or be part of a campaign. It can have a goal and due date set,. For example, a call for 50 people to call a prison by June 13th demanding an investigation into prisoner abuse. An action can also be turned into a fundraiser, allowing people to donate directly to the site through Stripe. No longer will groups be dependent on proprietary platforms such as GoFundMe and IndieGoGo.
